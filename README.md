# **CryptoGamingInsider** 🃏💰🤑

<br/>

This project is a Next.js-built blog website focused on crypto betting and gambling. 🎲 🎰 🃏

Next.js was chosen for this project for several reasons. First, to expand my knowledge as a front-end developer. 📚🤓 Also, it provides a powerful server-side rendering (SSR) feature, which improves the website's performance and user experience by generating HTML pages on the server instead of relying solely on client-side rendering. This makes the website faster to load and more SEO-friendly. 🔍

The website features a clean and modern design with a responsive layout built using Tailwind CSS. It includes a homepage with all blog posts, as well as dedicated pages for individual blog posts. 💻

_Note_: The reviews of crypto betting and gambling websites refer to **fake websites**, with the only purpose of show my skills as a developer and copywriter.

## Challenges and Learning 🤔💡

During the development of this project, I learnt how to use Next.js to create a server-side rendered blog website, style it with Tailwind CSS and make it fully responsive. It also gave me the chance to start studying TypeScript.

This project gave me the opportunity to learn practical skills like copywriting and SEO optimisation. I now have a better idea of how to choose relevant keywords while optimising blog posts for search engines. Compared to React, Next.js allowed for easier and faster deployment of static files. Finally, I also delved deeper into using Markdown for formatting blog content.

## Future Improvements 🚧

The website could be expanded by adding more functionalities, like a _search engine_,to allow users to find blog posts by keywords, and a _form_, for users to sign up for updates and newsletters. Additionally, provide a _back-end component_ so users can discuss and leave comments.
